OCaml-GPR - Efficient Gaussian Process Regression in OCaml
==========================================================

This [OCaml](http://www.ocaml.org)-library, which also comes with an elaborate
example application, implements some of the newest approximation algorithms
(e.g. _SPGP_) for scalable Gaussian process regression for arbitrary
covariance functions.  Here is an example graph showing the fit of such a
sparse Gaussian process to a nonlinear function:

Please refer to the [GPR
manual](https://bitbucket.org/mmottl/gpr/downloads/gpr_manual.pdf)
for further details and to the [online API
documentation](http://mmottl.bitbucket.org/projects/gpr/api/) as programming
reference.
